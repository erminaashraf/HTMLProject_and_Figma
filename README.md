# HTMLProject_and_Figma
This repository contains my MGCR 331 â€“ HTML Project, a three-page website designed and coded using HTML and CSS.

The project transforms an Excel report into a visual, web-friendly presentation through:

Exported Excel charts and figures integrated as images

A consistent page layout with navigation links between three sections

A sidebar with external resources and a contact form built with labeled inputs, checkboxes, and buttons

A color palette and layout derived from Figma prototypes, following design principles taught in the course

The goal was to apply structured HTML and CSS for clear information hierarchy, accessibility, and visual coherence.
